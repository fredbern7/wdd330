        <h3>Client-side form Validation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Client-validation is done at the browser.</li>
            <li>Server-side validation is done at tne server.</li>
            <li>Reasons to use validation.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>We want to get the right data, in the right format.</em> Our applications won't work properly if our users' data is stored in the wrong format, is incorrect, or is omitted altogether.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>We want to protect our users' data.</em> Forcing our users to enter secure passwords makes it easier to protect their account information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>We want to protect ourselves.</em> There are many ways that malicious users can misuse unprotected forms to damage the application.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Types of Client-side validation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Built-in form validation</em> uses HTML form validation features, which we've discussed in many places throughout this module. This validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.
            <ul>
                <li>required, minlength, maxlegnth, min, max, type, pattern</li>
                <li>When the data is valid, The followings will happen:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The element matches the <em>:valid</em> CSS pseudo-class, which lets you apply a specific style to valid elements.</li>
                        <li>If the user tries to send the data, the browser will submit the form, provided there is nothing else stopping it from doing so (e.g., JavaScript).</li>
                        <li>If the user tries to send the data, the browser will block the form and display an error message.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The followings will happen when the data is not valid:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The element matches the <em>:invalid</em> CSS pseudo-class, and sometimes other UI pseudo-classes (e.g., <em>:out-of-range</em>) depending on the error, which lets you apply a specific style to invalid elements.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
            </ul>
            
            </li>
            <li><em>JavaScript</em> validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library).</li>
        </ul>
