                This is my final project for my Winter WWD330 class at Brigham Young University - Online. I was required
                to build an app that will pull data from API and save them into the localStorage.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project was made by Berny Fred when he joined WWD330 class at Brigham Young University - Online
                which was taught by Professor Chandler. The project required external sources for pulling data and local
                storage for saving data. The project also required to use of the Model View Control format.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name of this app is CookBook. The app allows a user to search for recipes and save them and view and
                delete them anytime they want. This app has only stored the recipes in the user's local storage and made
                it available to access when it is offline. One thing is that images would not be shown in the app when
                the device is offline.
            </p>
            <p>
                The video below is showing the creator demonstrating how to use this app.
